# Welcome to bosonic-jax

We present `bosonic-jax` as a framework with which to simulate quantum circuits built using bosonic quantum-error-correctable code qubits, such as the Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) code. As such, we build `bosonic-jax` ontop of `JAX` to enable the auto differentiable and accelerated unitary and hamiltonian simulation of these quantum circuits with experimentally realisitic noise and dissipation.
